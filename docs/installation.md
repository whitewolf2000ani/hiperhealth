# Installation

## Stable release

To install hiperhealth, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install hiperhealth
```

This is the preferred method to install hiperhealth, as it will always install
the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this
[Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.

## From sources

The sources for hiperhealth can be downloaded from the [Github repo]().

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MYORG/MYREPO
```

Or download the [tarball](/tarball/main):

```bash
curl -OJL /tarball/main
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```bash
./scripts/install-dev.sh
```
