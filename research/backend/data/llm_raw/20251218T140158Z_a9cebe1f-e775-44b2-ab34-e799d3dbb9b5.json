  "summary": "In patients presenting with migraine and stress-induced headache, the evaluation should focus on a thorough neurological and fundoscopic examination to exclude secondary causes, assessment of vital signs (especially blood pressure), musculoskeletal and temporomandibular joint examination to identify trigger points, and review of a headache diary or headache pattern. Neuroimaging (MRI or CT) is reserved for those with red flags, and psychological screening helps identify contributing stress or anxiety factors.",
